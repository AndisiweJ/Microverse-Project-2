  <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
  <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

  <code>Java and Javascript</code>
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World"></section>  
 <div><header>Hello World</header>
<p>
<code>Hello World</code>
<ul>
  <li>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</li>
</ul>
</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Variable"></section> 
  <div>header>Variable</header> 
<P>
<code>Variables</code>
<ul>
  <li>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</li>
</ul>
